Your privacy is important to us. This policy explains what information we collect and how we use it.

## Information We Collect

We collect the minimal information necessary to provide and improve our service:
- **Audio Data**: Your audio is streamed to our server for real-time translation. We **do not** store your audio data or any transcribed or translated text.

## How We Share Your Information

We value your privacy and limit how we share your data:

- **Audio Processing**: To provide the core translation functionality, our servers may send the audio data you provide to third-party service providers (such as Google and OpenAI) for processing. These providers process the audio to perform the requested translation. We require these providers to maintain the confidentiality and security of your data. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies:
