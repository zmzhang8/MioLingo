# Account and Data Deletion Policy for MioLingo

## Data We Collect

Our application uses email sign-in with a One-Time Password (OTP) solely for authentication purposes. We **do not** collect or store any personal information beyond the email address required to log you in and identify your account within the authentication system. No additional profile data, usage details (beyond what's necessary for basic app function), or other personal information is gathered or stored.

## Deleting Your Account

Since the only data associated with your account is the email address used for login, "deleting your account" means removing this email address from our authentication system. To permanently delete your authentication record, please navigate to the account page within the app and initiate the deletion process.

## Subscriptions

Please note that deleting your account record does **not** automatically cancel any active subscriptions you may have purchased. You must manage your subscriptions directly through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store where you made the purchase.

## Signing Out

If you simply wish to stop using the app without permanently deleting your login capability, you can sign out from the app at any time.
